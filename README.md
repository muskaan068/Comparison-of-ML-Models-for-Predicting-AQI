# Comparison-of-ML-Models-for-Predicting-AQI
This project aims to compare the performance of various machine learning models for predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) in different cities of India.Different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Lasso and polynomial regression will be trained on the chosen dataset to predict AQI.

The performance of each model will be evaluated based on various evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R-squared.
